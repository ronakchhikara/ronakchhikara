# 👋 Hey, I’m Ronak  

> 🛸 Not from Earth.  
> 💤 Extremely lazy (seriously, I’d nap in the middle of this README if I could).  
> 🏏 Massive cricket fan — I can calculate strike rates faster than I can get out of bed.  
> 💻 Here on GitHub to *dump... I mean share* my PC knowledge with the universe.  



## 🌌 About Me
- 🪐 Probably from a galaxy far, far away.  
- 🥱 Professional procrastinator — will code… eventually.  
- 🏏 Can discuss ODI stats for hours, but can’t remember my own Git commit messages.  
- 💡 Believe in “Ctrl + C” and “Ctrl + V” as the ultimate superpowers.  



## 🛠 My Toolkit
- 🖥 Windows (because that’s where my laziness thrives)  
- ⌨️ Random shortcuts only I understand  
- ⚡ Speed: Depends on the coffee intake  



## 🚀 Goals
- Conquer GitHub with questionable code quality.  
- Publish weird but useful PC tips.  
- Maybe… just maybe… finish that project I started 2 years ago.  



### 💬 Final Words
_"Work smart, not hard… or better yet, don’t work at all."_ 😏
